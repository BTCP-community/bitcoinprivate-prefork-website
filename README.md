## Testing Locally

You can quickly get a local server running for testing and developing using the following commands.

**You'll need to have the latest version of Node.JS installed.** Node.JS will not be required in whatever environment the outputted build files run in. The site is entirely static and does not depend on any backend.

**You'll also need to have the latest version of Bower installed.** Bower is also not required in production, only for building.

```
cd dev
npm install
bower install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

The website is currently hosted with github pages. Use `npm run build`, this will update the docs directory with the latest src changes.

The docs directory is what github pages hosts from.

```
npm run build
```
